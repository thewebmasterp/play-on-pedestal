# play-on-pedestal
play-on-pedestal is a little bash script that plays a sound file while decreasing the volume of all the other sink inputs.

## Usage
```
./play-on-pedestal.sh /path/to/sound/file
```

## Purpose
 I personally use it with dunst, so that when a notification pops up I'll clearly hear it and it won't get lost and mixed up with my currently playing music.

## Requirements
 It works with PulseAudio
